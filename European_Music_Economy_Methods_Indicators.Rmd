## Abstract

In the last decade, the evidence-based policy movement gained significant traction in Europe as well as globally. Its focus has been to increase the rigour of the evidence generated, to improve the credibility and understandability of evidence created for policy purposes.  As evidence-based policies often rely on scientific evidence, the evidence-based policy movement went hand in hand with the efforts to increase the transparency and reproducibility of scientific research (See: [@manifesto_for_reproducible_science_2017] and in an EU context [@JRC99722; @reproducibility_scientific_results_eu_2020; @progress_open_science_2020].)  

Our [Report on the European Music Economy](https://zenodo.org/record/6464782#.Ylq7JNpBzIU), and its supporting document, [Economy of music in Europe: Novel data collection methods and indicators](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6464990) will follow the Open Policy Analysis Guidelines and the best practices of the European Union's Knowledge For Policy and the [European Open Science Cloud](https://eosc-portal.eu/) portal. 

The aim of this document is to *share an open report that includes clear accounts of all methodological procedures, data, and assumptions.* Best practice: All project components are organized in a selfcontained folder using a Standard File Structure (SFS), and a readme file is included (in this case, [here](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/report-european-music-economy)). We place all files with SFS on the European open science repository Zenodo on [zenodo.org/communities/music_observatory/](https://zenodo.org/communities/music_observatory/).

## Data gaps

The _Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory_ (in short: EMO Feasibility Study)^[Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory [@emo_feasibility_study_2020].] has identified 13 data gaps, and 4 existing but publicly not available data sources.

II. [Filling the Data Gaps](#obj-economy-data-gaps)
&nbsp;
1. [Employment](#obj-economy-employment); 2. [Value of EU's music sector](#obj-economy-value-sector); 3. [Structure of the market](#obj-economy-market-sector); 4. [The impact of the not-forprofit sector on the overall economy of the music sector](#obj-economy-non-profit); 5. [Neighbouring rights](#obj-economy-neighboring); 6. [Music publishing](#obj-economy-music-publishing); 7. [Independent music companies](#obj-economy-independent-music); 8. [Live music](#obj-economy-live-music); 9. [Export](#obj-economy-music-export); 10. [Music retail](#obj-economy-background-music) or in-store public performance; 11. [Financing of the music sector](#obj-economy-financing); 12. [Live music regulation](#obj-live-music-regulation); 13. [Copyright regulations and evolution of copyright regimes](#obj-copyright-regulation).

Furthermore, the _EMO Feasiblity Study_ mentions existing data sources that are collected by various organizations, such as GESAC, CISAC and IFPI. 

II. [The Economy of Music Pillar of the Digital Music Observatory](#dmo-economy-pillar)
1. [From CEEMID to the Digital Music Observatory](#obj-diversity-ceemid-dmo) _This can be used in excellence / Objectives_ and _WP Implementation_.
2. [Cultural and Music Policy Relevance](#obj-diversity-policy) _This can be used as state-of the art in Objectives._
3. [Open Collaboration, Open Policy Analysis, and Open Data](#obj-diversity-OPA)
&nbsp;  _This overlaps with our general WP Implementation_.

III. [References](#obj-diversity-references)

The goals of the Diversity and Circulation Pillar greatly overlap with some aspects of the Economy of Music Pillar.

Cultural diversity policy goals, which want to ensure that the music scene of a country, region or city gets proper exposure on the local media and stages, or less popular genres still find a way to their audiences, go hand in hand with some competition policy and consumer protection targets, and they also align well with the objectives of intellectual property and copyright policies.  Because almost all income of artists is connected to the use of music, a lack of diversity, and less opportunities for small-language repertoires, classical or jazz music, also lead to inadequate income connected to their composers, performers and a devaluation of their copyrights and neighboring rights.  An excessive concentration of volume of use, and therefore revenues/market share for certain nations, or large publishers/labels is conflicting with competition policy goals.

The 8 years of research and policy use history of the Digital Music Observatory (formerly CEEMID) is connected both to competition law-based cases and cultural policy use cases, using the same data, and an overlapping methodology. 

```{r valuechainfigure-wp, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("plots", "Music_value_chain.png"))
```

In the 21st century, about 60% of the recorded music sales are made by streaming and user-uploaded content platforms where it is mainly not human curators but AI algorithms that match the vast supply of content to users.  These AI algorithms use machine learning from the available biographical, musicological, natural language processed lyrics and review information, the artists music history and the user interaction history, user demographics, and other complex, interrelated information.  Our experience shows that a strong presence on global streaming and UUG platform requires a very sophisticated data infrastructure and data knowledge that is not present in smaller, independent music businesses, and not even in small-country national organizations. 

The data of the Digital Music Observatory is used – outside the scope of this proposal – in trustworthy AI research when we try to assign blame for the less-than-optimal outcome for small business and small country repertoires for copyright data and metadata problems.  These problems related to a larger problem that we work in both the _Economy of Music Pillar_^[Observing, Monitoring and Analysing the Economy of Music in Europe with the Digital Music Observatory [@DMO-music-economy-pillar].] and the the _Diversity and Circulation Pillar_^[Measuring and Monitoring the Diversity Circulation of European Music with Open Source Technology and Data Sharing Witin the Digital Music Observatory [@DMO-music-diversity-pillar].]. Indirectly, because copyright data management/metadata management problems are among the causes of _Music export_, _Structure of the market_, 
_Value of EU's music sector_, _Employment_, _Independent music_, _Neighbouring rights_ problems and data gaps of the _Economy of Music Pillar_, not only that of the Diversity & Circulation problems. Indirectly, because researching these problems requires the same data sources, the same data processing about music present in broadcast, retransmission, streaming and other non-mechanical channels of distribution.

In other words, the _Economy of Music Pillar_ relies on very similar data like the _Diversity and Circulation Pillar_, but it uses the data in different analytical models. As a joint research project of IViR, Reprex, and other partners found, "… _costs_ can also be understood in a broader sense. Instead of confining the analysis to monetary aspects, it is important to consider broader cultural repercussions, in particular the impact of standardised data formats and comprehensive copyright data systems on cultural diversity, recognition and attribution (in the sense of the moral rights enjoying protection under international copyright law and the national copyright systems of EU Member States) and the visibility and availability of the full spectrum of European creative works."^[Ensuring the Visibility and Accessibility of European Creative Content on the World Market - The Need for Copyright Data Improvement in the Light of New Technologies and the Opportunity Arising from Article 17 of the CDSM Directive [@ssrn3785272].].


Last, but not least, the [Towards a competitive, fair and sustainable European music ecosystem](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl2-2022-heritage-01-05)^[Research and innovation on cultural heritage and CCIs - 2022 (HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01)] grant call stresses out that "proposals should further research on the economy of the streaming models". While the _EMO _Feasibility Study_ places the topic of in the _Music Innovation Pillar_^[See Observing and Promoting Innovation in the Music Ecosystem and Future Trends in Music with Open Data and Open Collaboration [@DMO-music-innovation-pillar]], we deal with this problem in our [WP Music Economy](#obj-economy-data-gaps) and [WP Diversity & Circulation]()

## Proposed Work in the Economics of Music Pillar of the Digital Music Observatory {#wp-economy}

## Task list

The task list was part of our Proposal to the [Towards a competitive, fair and sustainable European music ecosystem](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl2-2022-heritage-01-05)^[Research and innovation on cultural heritage and CCIs - 2022 (HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01)] grant call, and with very little modifications became part of our Grant Agreement [@openmuse_2023].

The _Digital Music Observatory_ has experience with collecting and internationally harmonizing data in 12/13 identified data gaps, with the exceptions of _The impact of the not-for-profit sector on the overall economy of the music sector_, and already has even pan-European and shared data in some areas, and maps the metadata of 4/4 identified existing, not available data sources. We will create and release some datatables and indicators for almost all data gaps, but our focus will be different from the _EMO Feasibility Study_, because the grant call itself has different priorities.

### T1.1 Music economy methodology and indicators {#wp-economy-indicators}

We will translate the data gaps identified by the _Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory_. According the _Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory_ “CEEMID [currently the Digital Music Observatory] can transfer thousands of indicators that are reproducible and verifiable, open-source software that creates them to a European Music Observatory. In particular, CEEMID provides a useful and interesting approach to harnessing the possibilities of open data in Europe in relation to the music sector, which should be further explored by the European Music Observatory in its start-up phase."^[Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory  [@emo_feasibility_study_2020, pp147-148].]  Obviously, these transferable indicators are "indicator candidates", because they have to be proven to be useful for representative music organizations, European or national policymakers. We will use this huge data trove created over 8 years and covering more than 30 European countries as a starting point. We will implement he Eurostat indicator design methodology with these "indicator candidates" for music stakeholders, according to the mapping of the music stakeholders to provide them with appropriate, understandable statistical information. While we will create indicator candidates, and final indicators in some cases for all EU member states, we will particularly focus on calculating indicator values in the Slovak Republic, where we will feed them into the policymaking channels of the Slovak Ministry of Culture and the Culture Committe of the Slovak National Assembly.  ([EUBA](#euba), [IViR](#ivir), [Reprex](#reprex))

### T1.1.1 Methodology of indicator design

In our projects, we follow the best practices of key business information, statistical, and evidence-based policy indicator design. In doing so, we would like to find synergies among various recent innovations in statistics and open science. Throughout the project, we will follow the Eurostat guidelines on creating new indicators [@eurostat_harmonised_indicators_2014; @angelova-tosheva_methodological_2019; @eurostat_guide_2018], which will ensure broad consensus-forming among stakeholders around the objectives and methodology of the improved measurements.

```


- ST1 Data gap analysis and preliminary indicator candidate design. 
- ST2 We will invite all representative European music stakeholders, and Slovak policy stakeholders to a workshop in Bratislava, where we will present many indicator candidates, show alternatives, and educate business and policy users about data availability and different use cases of various indicator candidates. [EUBA](#euba), [SOZA](#soza), [IViR](#ivir), [Reprex](#reprex)
- ST3 We translate indicator needs into data collection tasks to be carried out in T1.2, T2.2, T3.2, and T4.1. [EUBA](#euba), [SOZA](#soza), [IViR](#ivir), [Reprex](#reprex)

### T1.1.2 MSME survey design
Because freelancer and microneterprises are excluded from current (official) data collection, design a data collection method, with microenterprise-appropriate methodology, that collects robust data with simple questions, and integrating data from, or actual simplified financial statements, incluing at least four EU countries (where we have partners, Italy, Slovakia, Hungary, Netherlands, Lithuania). The methodology must be robust to work in different language settings. ([EUBA](#euba), with language and local accounting standards support [Sant'Anna](#sant-anna), [Reprex](#reprex), [IViR](#ivir) _DA: only to the extend of finding "total turnover" on a microenteprise balance, making sure that a Dutch, Italian, Hungarian label or performer understand the question_)

### T1.1.3 Valuation & shadow prices 
([Sant'Anna](#sant-anna), [Reprex](#reprex), [EUBA](#euba)). This task depends on the inputs of T2.1.3 in [T2.1 Music diversity and circulation methodology and indicators](#wp-diverstiy-indicators)
Music has different uses and different income models: the live performance model, and the mechanical licensing (including private copying compensation), public performance licensing, and the the streaming licensing models.  The streaming licensing models can be seen as a mix of the mechanical and public performance models.  We do not find the "cost approach" to be relevant in valuations, and we will use the music-specific versions of the "income approach" (streaming) and the "market comparators approach" (everything else)^[ [@smith_monetization_2014; @flignor_orozco_ip_valuation_2006; @puca_intangible_2019]]. 

- ST1 We will use the "income approach", more precisely, a discounted cash-flow model for streaming valuation.  After having individuated a suited stochastic process to describe the time series of the song’s performance, we will use valuation techniques derived from the financial literature, building of the work of the task leader^[Botazzi et al: Uncertainty in Firm Valuation and a Cross-Sectional Misvaluation Measure [@botazzi_cordoni_et_al_2020].] for estimating its value. These models will be possibly augmented by fixed song-specific, correction resulting from the clustering analysis. This shall be instrumental to build valuations at the artist or label level by means of aggregation. Moreover, it will allow us to perform out-of-sample predictions about the future value of an artist or a label. <MX-X>

- ST2 We will use the "market comparator approach" in valuing public performance, the value gap, and free uses. We will further develop the market comparator model first published by IFPI^[Valuing the use of recorded music [@pwc_valuing_2008]], and perfected by Artisjus, SOZA and Reprex^[ References here], with particular attention to the zero-price platforms.  Our methodology had been applied for calculating the "value gap" caused by the lack of licensing on user-uploaded content platforms^[On the value gap see [@cisac_valuegap_2017; @gesac_make_2016; @moore_value_2016], a calculation of the value gap with the market comparators model can be found in _Private Copying in Croatia_ [@antal_pcr_croatia_2019], and in the not-public but more detailed models developed with Artisjus and Reprex _The Competition of Unlicensed, Licensed and Illegal uses on the Markets of Music and Audiovisual Works [A szabad felhasználások, a jogosított tartalmak és az illegális felhasználások versenye a zenék és audiovizuális alkotások hazai piacán]_ [@antal_szabad_2018_en]], and our refined approach can be seen as a first  first impact assessment on the attempt to close the "value gap"  by the Copyright Directive^[On the value gap see ].  Our comparisons will take into consideration existing jurisprudence on applying such comparisons.^[The jurisprudence of the Court of the European Union, particularly _OSA v Léčebné lázně Mariánské Lázně_ [@cjeu_osa_2014] and _AKKA/LAA vs Konkurences padome_ [@cjeu_akka_2017] must be considered when making market comparisons.]

### T1.2 Music economy data collection, synthesis, and reporting {#wp-economy-data}

This task will collect and report the data points identified in [T1.1](#wp-economy-indicators). 

**T1.2.1** This will involve scaling up and refining the secondary data work currently performed by the DMO; This task will map data sources on the entire value chain of the European music ecosystem using using our [Methodology for the socio-economic, socio-legal and quantiative musicological research of European music](#method-socio-economic) described in \@ref(method-socio-economic).

**T1.2.2** In case when pre-existing music use data is needed, we will use standardized data provided by [SOZA](#soza) and [Muzikautor](#muzikautor), and in some cases, [Artisjus](#artisjus). Because their data systems are harmonized via GESAC and CISAC, these steps can be replicated in any European county.

**T1.2.3** Our previous detailed research in Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia shows that the biggest quantity of music use, expressed in annual hours of use, happens on zero-price platforms or other, not licensed forms of music. On zero-price platforms, like radio or user-uploaded content streaming (like YouTube) the users do not pay directly, but they are exposed to commercials; in non-licensed forms of illegal streaming, home copying and piracy, users enjoy non-licensed streams or create mechanical copies wihtout a license. Because ‘free’ uses have no direct licensing or sales to the user, the transactions have no accounting trail and the quantities must be estimated with empirical surveys.  We will use the Cultural Access and Participation Survey to estimate the “free” uses, following the guidelines set by ESSnet-Culture, and our experience in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia. We will improve earlier research results of IViR and Sant'Anna in xxxx, and Artisjus and Reprex in Hungary. For comparability, we will replicate earlier research in Italy and Hungary, and we will transfer the know-how to Bulgaria for an impact assessment. 

**T1.2.3.* We will rely on our expertise in conducting music creator and professional surveys, and enterprise surveys to design a mixed professional/microenterprise-suitable enterprise survey to collect data about the turnover, prices, employment and other information about the music sector. We will rely on the survey harmonization efforts of the earlier CEEMID  It will also involve conducting enterprise surveys in the target markets (?Bulgaria, ?Finland, ?Germany, ?Italy, Slovakia); 
The questionnaire design will be informed by principles of reproducibility, and will aim to introduce a new best practice in MSME-appropriate surveying. 

**T1.2.3** We will synthesise survey, simplified financial report, and SNA data to calculate the gross value added and employment capabilities of the music industry. ([EUBA](#euba))


### T1.3 Music valuation policy context, pilot studies, and impact pathways {#wp-economy-impact}

This task will comprise four subtasks: 

**T1.3.1** Analysis of the legal and policy context of music economics on the EU27+ level, utilising the open policy analysis framework (M1-10); 

**T1.3.2** Implementation of a pilot study: the transfer of valuation methodologies developed in the CEEMID project in Hungary and Slovakia to improve the music creator earnings in the poorest EU member states (in terms of creator revenue), Bulgaria. [... more description here...]
The results of this case study will rely not only on tasks in  (T1.1.2 MSME survey design, T1.2.1, T1.2.3, but also on estimates derived from the Cultural Access and Paricipation surveys in _WP Music & Society_.)

**T1.3.3** Our Consortium members have been researching both consumer behavior and artist revenues before and during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We will rely on our pre-existing, harmonized, and comparable research in Hungary, Slovakia---as described in T1.2.2, and other countries on artist income---relying on our methodology described in T1.2.3 ; detailed consumer surveying before and during the pandemic in Slovakia,  and before, during and after the pandemic in Hungary; and a pan-European survey carried out by IViR during . 

**T1.3.4** The co-creation of guidelines and recommendations for scaling and transfering the methods developed in the pilot on an EU27+ level.
