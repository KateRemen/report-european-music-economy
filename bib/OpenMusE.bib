	title = {Open Music Europe ({OPENMUSE}) – An Open, Scalable, Data-to-Policy Pipeline for European Music Ecosystems},
	url = {https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101095295},
	abstract = {{OpenMuse} brings together music industry stakeholders and researchers from 11 {EU} countries and Ukraine. Our consortium recognises that placing European music ecosystems on a more competitive, fair, and sustainable footing requires evidence-based policymaking, business planning, and accuracy. We provide the data needed for these actions. Using transparent methods and tools, {OpenMusE} maps the policy and data landscape; bridges data gaps; and empowers stakeholders and policymakers to take data-driven actions. Our project is grounded on principles of open policy analysis, open science, and open-source software development. We work with stakeholders to identify data gaps on the {EU}, national, and regional levels; co-create indicators and methods for bridging them; develop free software tools for data collection and analysis; and report not just our findings, but every step taken to reach them. This is the logic behind our Open Music Observatory ({OMO}), an open-source platform that provides 360-degree intelligence on the music industry by integrating numerous data sources. The {OMO} is highly automated, providing “living policy documents” that refresh when the backend datasets are updated: these datasets include official statistics on music goods and services; data on musical participation via pan-European surveys, rights-holder data voluntarily shared by industry partners, and streaming service data sampled using novel algorithms developed by our consortium. Using the {OMO} and our open-source software, music {MSMEs} without technical departments or expertise will be able to access and analyse open data; model volume and value, including of zero-price uses; create better business models; and generate corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports; all at a fraction of current costs. We validate these tools in four pilot studies that will bring concrete benefits to stakeholders within the project lifespan.},
